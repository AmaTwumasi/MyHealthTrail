            <h2>Health and Safty during Pregnancy</h2>
            <p>Pregnant women are often over guilded with the 
              do's and don't. don't eat this, eat this, do this and 
              other conflicting rules. Let's help to keep it straight
            </p>
            <p><b>Below are some healhty pratice for pregnant women</b></p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Eating Right</dt>
              <dd>Eating healthy food is very important. you will
                need more iron, calcium, Protein, folic acid, calories and 
                other nutrients that you can think of. The food you eat are the main
                sources of nutrients for your baby. Make sure to eat a balanced 
                diet.
              </dd>
              <dt>Say No to Alcohol</dt>
              <dd>Hey you! stop that. Alcohol is not safe for you and your
                baby. Whoever you that it will make the baby sharp is dumb.
                When you take alcohol it goes into blood and gets to your baby
                through the umbilical cord. This can slow down the baby's growth
                affecting your baby's brain and cause birth defect.
              </dd>
              <dt>Keeping fit</dt>
              <dd>Fitness goes hand in hand with eating right
                Healthy pregant woman should get at least 2 hours of
                moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week.   
              </dd>
              <dt>Medicine and Herbs</dt>
              <dd>You and your baby are connected. The medicines you use, 
                including over-the-counter, herbal, and prescription drugs
                 or supplements, might get into your baby's body, too. Many
                  medicines and herbs are known to cause problems during 
                  pregnancy, including birth defects. For some medicines,
                   we don't know that much about how they might affect pregnancy 
                   or the developing fetus. This is because medicines are rarely 
                   tested on pregnant women for fear of harming the fetus.Always 
                   speak with your doctor before you start or stop any medicine. 
                   Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you 
                   and your baby than using the medicine.</dd>
                   <dt>Vitamins and Minerals</dt>
                   <dd>Ask your doctor about taking a prenatal vitamin 
                    and mineral supplement every day to be sure you are
                     getting enough of the nutrients you and your baby needs. 
                     You also can check the label on the foods you buy to 
                     see how much of a certain nutrient the product contains. 
                     Women who are pregnant need more of these nutrients than 
                     women who are not pregnant</dd>
